            - ssh -i "keyName.pem" userName@IP_add / @IP_DNS_add
            - IP_DNS_add format : ec2-IP.region.compute.amazonaws.com.
            - After connection, The desktop terminal becomes terminal of UBUNTU on AWS.
            - vim editor [cms: wq].
- Via Ec2 serial console.

Service health :
- normal operation and availability zones.
